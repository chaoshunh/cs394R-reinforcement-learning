# Thompson Sampling vs UCB
The goal is to study Thompson sampling algorithm, and compare it with the UCB action-selection
procedure in a k-armed Bandit setting. In addition to the comparison of the performance of the two algorithms for stationary
and non-stationary tasks, the study also includes comparison of different priors for reward distri-
bution in Thompson sampling, and evaluates the effect of non-stationarity on different priors.
